PERSONALISED HOME FILE SERVER

Server side:
Old laptop that runs custom OS specialised to receive images / text / docs and save them on the hard disk 

Client side:
Use an app which on enabling and connecting to your laptop (server) should automatically back up your images and text files. 
Provide an UI to view the images as well.

Could even add folders. So each user in the family could have their own folder which could have access controls as well.
