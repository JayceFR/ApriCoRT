Custom OS 

  Custom Kernel 
    
    Cross Compiler 
    A compiler that runs on platform A (host) but generates executables for platform B (target)
    Built the cross compiler from source code 
    So now the new gcc can be accessed by 
    i686-elf-gcc --version. 
    Nice!

    BootStrap assembly stub
    Now we write the bootstrap which bascially assigns some space for the stack pointer (16 KiB)
    then calls the main function of our C program i.e. the KERNEL 
    to assemble it use 
    i686-elf-as OS/boot.s -o boot.o
    Nice!
